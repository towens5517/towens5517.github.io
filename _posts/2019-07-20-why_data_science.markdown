Out of all of the different software engineering programs, data science whispered to me.

Since elementary school, the computer has been the biggest tool in my learning experience. My mother took the opportunity to use the many learning programs and 'games' that were available (in the late 90s and early 00s) to supplement mine and my siblings' education. I grew up using a computer to learn math, reading, and language skills. Learning was always fun and stimulating for me.

In high school, I took a coding language class instead of the usual Spanish/French/German languages offered at many high schools. Apparently coding was not popular at my school, so there was only one class. That year I decided that web development (which is all we discussed) was not something I was really in to.

After I graduated, I knew I wanted to continue my education in the field of software engineering, but I knew I did not want to create websites, or companies, or apps (even though I am a big fan/consumer of all of those things).  I 'discovered' data science simply by clicking on the available programs that Flatiron offer. I did a quick Google search to find out that data science was something I could see myself becoming passionate about.

I knew that my love for gathering information and analyzing the differences/similarities would be supported through my data science journey. My degree in Anthropology was largely driven by need to be challenged by information that might be unfamiliar to me, but could be manipulated to make near-perfect sense. My college background and personal skills fit a lot better in the realm of data science over the other programs being commonly offered online. And I paid a lot of money for that degree... so...
